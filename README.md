# GIF-Tastic!

This application allows a user to retrieve hilarious GIFs of their favorite TV Shows! The user can use the buttons provided or create their own buttons which retrieve GIFs as well! The application uses a GIPHY API, AJAX, and jQuery to display popular GIFs from across the web. Each GIF that appears on the page appears as a still image, but each image can be clicked to display its animated state. It was a challenge to retrieve GIFs from the specific button that was clicked. The user's input is collected in an array which is looped through in order to create buttons. Once the show's button is clicked, another for loop is used to retrieve the results. Nearly every part of this game has been created dynamically using jQuery. 

Please Enjoy!
